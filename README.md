 ## Overview

  The Non-Cartesian Etch-A-Sketch is a browser-based simulation that offers a unique drawing experience. Unlike traditional Etch-A-Sketch toys, which operate in Cartesian coordinates (x and y axes), this simulation operates in non-Cartesian or polar coordinates. In polar coordinates, the position of a point is determined by its distance from a fixed point (the origin) and the angle it makes with a fixed line (the reference axis).

  ## Non-Cartesian Coordinate Systems

  Non-Cartesian coordinate systems, such as polar coordinates, offer alternative ways to represent points in space. While Cartesian coordinates are based on orthogonal axes (x and y), non-Cartesian systems use different parameters, such as radius and angle, to specify the position of a point. These systems are particularly useful in contexts where circular or radial symmetry is prevalent, such as in polar graphs or certain engineering applications.

  ## Etch-A-Sketch

  Etch-A-Sketch is a classic mechanical drawing toy invented by Andr√© Cassagnes and manufactured by the Ohio Art Company. It consists of a gray screen in a red plastic frame with two white knobs on the front. The knobs allow users to move a stylus that displaces aluminum powder on the back of the screen, creating a line drawing. Shaking the toy evenly redistributes the powder, erasing the drawing.

## How to Use

This browser-based simulation of a polar coordinate Etch-A-Sketch offers an interactive experience:

- **Control Knobs**: Use the arrow keys to manipulate the knobs. Press up or down to adjust the radius and left or right to change the angle.
- **Shake to Erase**: Shake your device to erase the sketch and start anew.

## Features

- **Enhanced Controls**: Added touch screen and accelerometer support for a more versatile user experience.
- **Fluid Drawing**: The canvas dynamically responds to your input, offering smooth and intuitive drawing capabilities.

## Compatibility

The Non-Cartesian Etch-A-Sketch is compatible with modern web browsers and devices. Whether you're using a desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone, you can enjoy this simulation on a wide range of platforms.
